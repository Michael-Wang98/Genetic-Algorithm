# Genetic-Algorithm-Optimization

This program demonstrates the optimization of a multi-variable system using Genetic Algorithm Operators. With regards to complex optimization problems where it is unclear how changes to inputs of a system will affect the desirability the outputs a way to efficiently determine the ideal inputs is to randomly generate inputs, determine their "fitness" (how optimally they solve the problem) encode them as genetic sequences and have them "mate" and exchange genetic information before selecting the fittest to remain across generations through survival of the fittest. 

## How to use 

Adjust the Global variables as you see fit in order to alter the parameters of the Genetic Algorithm which includes the size of the population, number of generations and the odds of the various operators triggering during mating. Then run the script and oberseve the results :)
